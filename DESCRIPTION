Description: A toolkit to detect clusters from distance matrices. Distance 
    matrices are assumed to be the distance matrices between cells for multiple 
    animals (Caenorhabditis elegans) from input time-series matrices. 
    Some functions for generating distance matrices from time-series matrices, 
    performing clustering using distance matrices, evaluation of clustering 
    results, visualization of clustering and evaluation results, 
    and downloading distance matrices between cells for 
    multiple animals (Caenorhabditis elegans) from figshare.
