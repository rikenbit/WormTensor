Description: Description: A toolkit to detect clusters from distance matrices. 
    The distance matrices are assumed to be calculated between the cells of 
    multiple animals (Caenorhabditis elegans) from input time-series matrices. 
    Some functions for generating distance matrices, performing clustering, 
    evaluating the clustering, and visualizing the results of clustering and 
    evaluation are available. We're also providing the download function to 
    retrieve the pre-calculated distance matrices from figshare.
